# UnityLink Blueprint

## Overview

UnityLink is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to foster social connections and community engagement. It provides a seamless and intuitive user experience, enabling users to interact through various features such as real-time chat, video calls, and issue-specific discussion rooms. The app is built with Firebase, ensuring robust backend services for authentication, data storage, and real-time communication.

## Key Features

- **Authentication:** Secure user authentication with options for email/password, Google Sign-In, and anonymous access.
- **User Profiles:** Personalized user profiles with customizable display names and profile pictures.
- **Real-time Chat:** Instant messaging functionality for one-on-one and group conversations.
- **Video Calling:** High-quality video call capabilities for face-to-face interactions.
- **Issue Rooms:** Dedicated spaces for users to discuss specific topics and collaborate on solutions.
- **Discover:** A feature to explore and connect with other users and communities within the app.

## Design and Theming

The app follows Material Design 3 principles, with a consistent and visually appealing theme. It supports both light and dark modes, and the theme is easily customizable through a centralized `ThemeData` object. The typography is handled by the `google_fonts` package, providing a wide range of font options.

## Architecture

UnityLink is built using a layered architecture, with a clear separation of concerns between the UI, business logic, and data layers. It utilizes the `provider` package for state management and dependency injection, ensuring a scalable and maintainable codebase.

## Getting Started

To run the app, you need to have Flutter and Firebase configured in your development environment. Clone the repository, install the dependencies, and run the app on your preferred device or emulator.
